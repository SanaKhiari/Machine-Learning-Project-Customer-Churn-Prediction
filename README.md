# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction in the Telecom Sector Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer data, we aim to identify key factors contributing to churn and build predictive models to help telecom companies retain customers.

## 📖 Research Papers Reproduced  
This project is based on the reproduction and expansion of three key research papers:  

1️⃣ **Customer Churn Prediction in Telecom Sector Using Machine Learning Techniques**  
2️⃣ **Implementing Machine Learning Techniques for Customer Retention and Churn Prediction in Telecommunications**  
3️⃣ **Explaining Customer Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry Using Tabular Machine Learning Models**  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of customer-related features such as:  
- 📌 **Subscription details**: Contract type, tenure, payment method  
- 📊 **Usage patterns**: Call duration, internet usage, number of support calls  
- 💰 **Billing information**: Monthly charges, total charges  
- 🚀 **Target variable**: `Churn` (1 = Churn, 0 = Retained)  

## 🚀 Project Workflow (CRISP-DM Framework)  
We follow the **CRISP-DM** methodology for this project:  

1️⃣ **Business Understanding**: Understanding churn impact on telecom companies.  
2️⃣ **Data Understanding**: Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
3️⃣ **Data Preparation**: Handling missing values, feature encoding, and scaling.  
4️⃣ **Modeling**: Training and evaluating ML models such as:  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Trees  
   - Random Forest  
   - XGBoost  
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
5️⃣ **Evaluation**: Using performance metrics like:  
   - **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**  
   - **ROC-AUC**  
   - **Confusion Matrix**  
   - **Feature Importance**  
6️⃣ **Deployment (Optional)**: Exporting the best model and serving it via an API.  

## 📊 Results & Key Findings  
- ✅ **Best performing model**: [Model Name] with **[Accuracy/F1-score]**
